# Sudoku Solver

This Sudoku Solver project is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles. It uses the backtracking algorithm to recursively fill in the empty spaces in the puzzle until a valid solution is found. The program takes user input for each row of the puzzle and displays the solved puzzle using the PyAutoGUI library. I did this project by watching a tutorial video.

## Running the Code with a Sudoku Puzzle from a Website

To see the code in action with a Sudoku puzzle from a website, follow these steps:

1. Visit a Sudoku puzzle website, such as sudoku.com.
2. Take note of each line of the Sudoku puzzle.
3. Execute the code sudoku.py.
4. Manually input each line of the Sudoku puzzle into the terminal, pressing Enter after each line.
5. After inputting all the lines, click on the first square of the Sudoku puzzle on the website. (You have 3 seconds to click on the first square after input the last line!!)
6. The code will automatically complete the Sudoku puzzle for you.

Please note that the code assumes that the Sudoku puzzle you input is solvable. If you input an unsolvable puzzle, the code may not terminate or provide incorrect results.
